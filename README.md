# Installation

The installation of this script is super easy. If you can install normal PHP-based scripts on your server, you can install our script. We will guide you through the installation process step by step on your server.

If you extract the zip file, you will see three folders:

- `sql`
- `documentation`
- `main_files`

The "main_files" folder contains the main Laravel source codes, and the "sql" folder contains the main database file "database.sql".

## Creating Database using Cpanel

1. Login to your hosting's cPanel using the login information. You will see an interface like this:
